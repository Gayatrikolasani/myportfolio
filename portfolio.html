          <p>
            I am a Computer Science & Engineering (AI) graduate with a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and evidence-based problem solving.
            I enjoy working at the intersection of data, algorithms, and real-world outcomes—transforming raw information into insights that support smarter decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
           My key academic work includes developing an<strong>AI-Powered Career Pathway Guidance System </strong>that provides personalized recommendations by analyzing user profiles and skill gaps.
            I built the complete data preprocessing pipeline, applied machine learning models, and evaluated the system using metrics such as accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also contributed to a robotics hackathon project, co-developing an <strong>Autonomous Shopping Trolley</strong> using Python and ROS, where I focused on improving navigation performance, sensor integration, and system optimization.
