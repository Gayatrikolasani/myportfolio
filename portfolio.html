        <p>
          I am a Computer Science &amp; Engineering (AI) graduate with a strong foundation in
          data analytics, machine learning, and evidence-based problem solving. I enjoy
          working at the intersection of data, algorithms, and real-world outcomes —
          transforming raw information into insights that support smarter decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          My key academic work includes developing an
          <strong>AI-powered Career Pathway Guidance System</strong> that provides personalized
          recommendations by analyzing user profiles and skill gaps. I built the data
          preprocessing pipeline, applied machine learning models, and evaluated the system
          using metrics such as accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also contributed to a robotics hackathon project, co-developing an
          <strong>Autonomous Shopping Trolley</strong> using Python and ROS. I focused on
          improving navigation performance, sensor integration, and overall system optimization.
